\section{Introduction}
\label{sp:intro}

Apache Spark~\cite{spark} is a general purpose data processing framework that supports wide range of applications from \emph{batch} processing, \emph{stream} processing, \emph{graph} processing to \emph{machine learning}, etc. In this chapter the architecture of Apache Spark and Spark Streaming -- as one of its sub projects -- will be explored and discussed. Throughout the chapter, minor examples will also be presented to further simplify the concepts. This chapter is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sp:basics} explains the basic concepts of Apache Spark. Then, section~\ref{sp:rdd} explains \emph{Resilient Distributed Datasets} (RDDs) which is the most integral component of the Apache Spark. Section~\ref{sp:dstream} explains \emph{Discretized Streams} (DStreams) as the fundamental building block for data stream processing applications. Finally, section~\ref{sp:conc} concludes this chapter.

\section{Basic Concepts}
\label{sp:basics}

Map-Reduce~\cite{Dean:2004} and its derivative projects have been widely used by \emph{data-oriented} applications to process and crunch huge datasets over last the decade. In traditional Map-Reduce environments, developers typically create \emph{acyclic} data flow graphs to process input data. However, as confirmed by \textcite{Zaharia:2010}, there are two categories of applications that are not well suited for this architecture.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Iterative Jobs} Many machine learning applications process the same input \emph{iteratively}. In traditional model, each iteration should be defined as a separate MapReduce job. While this is feasible, but for each job, input data has to be loaded from disk which leads to serious performance issues.
    \item \textbf{Interactive Analysis} MapReduce derivative projects like Hive~\cite{hive} and Pig~\cite{pig} have been extensively used to run SQL queries on top of massive datasets. Whenever a user submits different queries over the same dataset, the ideal solution would be to load all datasets into memory once and then execute different queries on top of it. However, with traditional model of execution each query shall be defined as a separate job which reads input data from disk.
\end{itemize}
Apache spark has been designed from ground up to resolve these issues. It provides a large stack of tools to facilitate processing large datasets. Figure~\ref{fig:spark-eco} depicts tools provided by Spark.

\subsection{Spark Runtime Architecture}
\label{sp:run}

Any Spark application consists of multiple components at runtime. The following lists the relevant components from a high level point of view.
\begin{description}[leftmargin=0pt]
    \item[Driver Process Driver] It is the core component of every Spark application. It is a single process and runs on one of the nodes in the cluster. It maintains all the critical information such as user's program, input files, output files and data flow of the application. The driver process should run during the runtime the of the application. In case driver process fails, the whole application is considered as \emph{dead} and should be restarted by any \emph{fault-tolerant} mechanism available in the cluster.
    \item[Distributed File System] It provides a shared file system accessible by any node in the cluster. There is no limitation on type of the file system but typically \emph{Hadoop Distributed File System} (HDFS)~\cite{hadoop} is used.
    \item[Worker Processes] A collection of worker processes known as \emph{executors} that run on cluster nodes. Executors run user defined code. During the runtime of the application each worker consume any number of input records, processes it based on user defined code and emits any number of output records. Similar to driver process, liveness of the worker processes shall by monitored. However, the role of worker processes are not as critical as driver process, even though they may fail for any reason. Workers have access to load/store data files from/to distributed file system or local memory of the machine. During lifetime of the application, status of the workers will be reported to driver process.
    \item[User Defined Code] Provided by user and caries the main logic of the application.
\end{description}
Figure~\ref{fig:spark-runtime}\footnote{The figure has been partially taken from~\textcite{Zaharia:2012}} depicts coarse grained architecture of a Spark application and table~\ref{tab:spark-runtime} summarizes these components.

\subsection{Spark Cluster Manager}
\label{sp:cluster}

Section~\ref{sp:run} described the coarse grained architecture of Spark. However, from a more fine grained point of view, there is missing component known as \emph{Cluster Manager}. Cluster Manager controls the \emph{assignment} of executors to cluster nodes. It monitors liveness of executors during lifetime of the Spark application. \emph{Spark Session} is the entry point for all Spark applications and has the responsibility to communicate with Cluster Manager to distribute tasks and collect task progress reports from executors. It also distributes user defined code on Worker nodes. Figure~\ref{fig:spark-cluster}\footnote{The figure has been partially taken from~\textcite{spark-guide}} illustrates the role of Cluster Manager in Spark.
\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption[Architecture of Spark Cluster Manager]{Architecture of Spark Cluster Manager}
    \label{fig:spark-cluster}
\end{figure}

Note that, the term \emph{executor} is a conceptual term and implementation details may differ among different resource managers. Spark supports multiple Cluster Manager implementations. The following describes the most prominent implementations. It shall be noted that this list is a growing over time due to Spark's pluggable resource manager architecture. Table~\ref{tab:spark-cluster} summarizes available Cluster Manager architectures.
\begin{table*}[h]
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Cluster Manager} & \textbf{Description}\\
        \midrule
        Apache YARN & Hierarchical failure detection. Global Resource Manager monitors local Node Managers and Application Masters. Backup Resource Managers monitor global Resource Manager. Node Managers monitor local containers.\\
        Apache Mesos & Hierarchical failure detection. Mesos Master monitors Mesos Slaves and Framework Schedulers. Backup masters monitor Mesos Master. Mesos Slaves monitor local workers.\\
        Spark Standalone & Spark Master monitors Driver program and Spark Slaves. Backup master monitor Spark Master. Spark Slaves monitor local executors.\\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabularx}
    \centering
    \caption{Summary of Spark Cluster Managers}
    \label{tab:spark-cluster}
\end{table*}
\begin{description}[leftmargin=0pt]
    \item [Apache YARN] It is referred as \emph{Yet Another Resource Negotiator}~\cite{Vavilapalli:2013} and is the default resource manager for modern Hadoop workloads. It has a master-slave architecture and consists of a single global \emph{Resource Manager} -- most probably accompanied by a backup as well --  and several \emph{Node Managers} that run on each worker node. The concept of executor is implemented as \emph{containers} in YARN. Each container can hold a specific amount of node's processing power (CPU, RAM, Network, etc.). In YARN, any application is modeled with two components. First, \emph{Application Master} that maintains the necessary information to run the application -- Spark driver process in this case and second, several \emph{Workers} that run the user defined code. Both Application Master and Workers are executed in the context of YARN containers. 
    
    Fault-tolerance is provided at multiple levels. First, several backup nodes monitor the master resource manager via Zookeeper. In case master resource manager fails, one of the backup masters takes over the responsibility. Second, Applications Master reports its status to the global resource manager. In case, application master fails, the global resource manager launches a new Application Master on another node. Third, Workers provide different progress reports to Application Master and Node Managers. In case any Worker container fails, a new container will be allocated and the old one will be killed by the local Node Manager.
    \item [Apache Mesos] It is another dominant cluster scheduler for Spark~\cite{Hindman:2011}. It is a master-slave resource manager. A global resource manager -- known as \emph{Mesos Master} -- has cluster level view. On each node runs a single \emph{Mesos Slave} process. Mesos has a pluggable architecture for different class of application schedulers. That is, a single cluster can run a mixture of Spark, MPI, etc. jobs with different prioritizes for each application type. Each \emph{Framework Scheduler} handles corresponding jobs. For example, Spark scheduler, maintains multiple driver processes or MPI scheduler maintains multiple MPI applications. Free resources on each Mesos Slave are represented as empty \emph{slots} -- very much like containers in YARN -- and are allocated to one of the currently running jobs.
    
    Fault-tolerance is provided by a similar hierarchical approach like YARN. Mesos Master is monitored by several backups through Zookeeper. Mesos Slaves as well as Framework Schedulers are in turn monitored by Mesos Master. Each job is further monitored by corresponding Framework Scheduler. And finally, executors are monitored by Mesos Slaves. 
    \item [Spark Standalone] It is the default resource manager for Spark and will be used throughout this thesis. It also follows the master-slave model. \emph{Spark Master} is the global cluster level resource manager. On each cluster node runs a \emph{Spark Slave} process. Spark Slaves are responsible to run and monitor worker executors. It is possible to set default number of CPU cores and available memory for each executor though configuration, either \emph{statically} -- default value for all jobs -- or at specific job \emph{submission} time -- per job basis.
    
     Fault-tolerance is achieved by several counter measures. Figure~\ref{fig:spark-full}\footnote{The figure has been partially taken from~\textcite{spark-guide}} depicts all the measures. Similar to YARN and Mesos, a multi-level failure detection approach is exploited. Multiple backup nodes monitor the Spark Master via Zookeeper~(Case 1). Spark Slaves and Drivers are monitored by Spark Master (Case 2). Progress of each executor -- whether the assigned task is done or not -- is monitored by Driver (Case 3). Liveness of each executor is further monitored by corresponding local Spark Slave process (Case 5). Initial input and final output of the jobs are stored in a distributed replicated file system like HDFS. In case any executor fails to store its final output in DFS, it will relaunched by Spark on another node (Case 4). Intermediate results are stored locally without any fault-tolerance in mind. However, \emph{checkpoints} -- stored on DFS -- can be used in this case to recover from executor failures (Case 4). Refer to section~\ref{sp:rdd} for more information on checkpointing process.

\section{Resilient Distributed Datasets}
\label{sp:rdd}

\emph{Resilient Distributed Dataset} (RDD)~\cite{Zaharia:2012} is the basic building block of Spark's data processing pipeline. It is inspired by the same concepts behind \emph{shared memory} and enables \emph{iterative algorithms} and \emph{interactive analytics} to perform common operations directly on memory. RDDs are fault-tolerant and parallel data structures to let intermediate results of a Spark application to be stored in memory during multiple iterations. Existing distributed shared memory abstractions for cluster computing provide \emph{fine-grained} interface -- typically key/value -- to modify state. Unfortunately, with this approach the only way to provide fault-tolerance is the \emph{log shipping} approach that is already offered by distributed database systems.

Whereas, RDDs offer \emph{coarse-grained} interface based on \emph{immutable transformations}. Each transformation (\lstinline$map$, \lstinline$filter$, \lstinline$foreach$, \lstinline$groupByKey$, etc.) applies same application logic to all records that it contains. A dataset's \emph{lineage graph} is the \emph{chain}~-- \emph{sequence} -- of multiple transformations that produced the aforementioned dataset. With this approach only the transformation itself needs to be logged and shipped to other nodes to provide fault-tolerance. Since RDDs are already immutable, recomputing the lineage on other node is a trivial task. The RDD abstraction is useful in data intensive processing applications, since same operation is applied to many records. Table~\ref{tab:rdd-vs-dsm}\footnote{The table has been taken from~\textcite{Zaharia:2012}} summarizes the differences between RRDs and common distributed shared memory technologies.
\begin{table*}[h]
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Dimension} & \textbf{RDD} & \textbf{Distributed Shared Memory}\\
        \midrule
        Reads & Per record or per input file & Per key/value \\
        Writes & Coarse grained & Per key/value \\
        Consistency & Easy (Immutable RDDs) & Application dependent \\
        Fault-Tolerance & Lineage recomputation & Application dependent \\
        Straggler Mitigation & Parallel backup tasks & Application dependent \\
        Operator Placement & Based on data locality & Application dependent \\
        Behavior if not enough memory is available & Controlled serialization to disk & OS managed swapping\\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \centering
    \caption{High-Level Comparison of RDDs and Distributed Shared Memory Systems}
    \label{tab:rdd-vs-dsm}
\end{table*}

An RDD is a \emph{read-only}, \emph{partitioned} collection of records~\cite{Zaharia:2012}. RDDs can only be created through deterministic transformations from either \emph{stable stoage} or \emph{other RRDs}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stable storage}. In this case dataset is typically stored on a shared file system like HDFS and accessible from all nodes of the cluster.
    \item \textbf{Other RDDs}. In this case subsequent RDDs \emph{depend} on each other forming the lineage graph.
\end{itemize}

An RDD has enough information about how it was derived from other RDDs. This means it doesn't have to be materialized in every step of the pipeline. In other words, an RDD cannot reference another RDD that it cannot reconstruct after a failure. Additionally, users are able to control \emph{persistency} and \emph{partitioning} of RDDs.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Persistency}. Users can define which RDDs will be reused in next steps of the pipeline. They choose a storage strategy -- in-memory or disk-based -- to persist RDDs.
    \item \textbf{Partitioning}. Some transformations like \lstinline$groupByKey$ or \lstinline$join$ partition the original RDD into multiple secondary partitions. RDDs allow application developers to perform partitioning -- hash, range or any custom partitioning strategy -- such that relevant records are \emph{co-partitioned} on same machine. This is particularly useful for \emph{operator placement} optimizations.
\end{itemize}

In order to simplify the concept of lineage graph, listing~\ref{l:sp:log-error}\footnotemark and figure~\ref{fig:spark-lineage-sample}\footnotemark[\value{footnote}] illustrate a simple log processing pipeline and its corresponding generated lineage graph.

\subsection{RDD Transformations and Dependencies}
\label{sp:depend}

As mentioned, RDDs are the result of \emph{lazy} transformations derived from one another. In other words, RDDs are not materialized unless it is really needed. However, not all transformations are lazy. There are three major types of transformations.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Transformations without shuffling}. These are lazy transformations that doesn't cause any sort of shuffling among different nodes. That is, transformed records can still be further processed on the same node. For example \lstinline$map$ and \lstinline$filter$ are classified in this group.
    \item \textbf{Transformations with shuffling}. These are also lazy transformations but they will trigger shuffling process between nodes. The behavior of the shuffling processes is influenced by the implementation of \emph{partitioners}. As an example, \lstinline$groupByKey$, \lstinline$reduceByKey$ and \lstinline$join$ belong to this group.
    \item \textbf{Actions}. These transformations trigger RDD materialization process. That is, the actual computation of RDDs don't realize until this type of transformation is met in lineage graph. For example, \lstinline$count$, \lstinline$collect$ and \lstinline$save$ are classified in this group.
\end{itemize}

In a lineage graph RDDs are derived from one another. This makes each RDD depend on one or several RDDs depending on type of the transformation. There are two types of dependencies among RDDs.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Narrow}. When one partition of the parent RDD is used by at most one partition of the child RDD, then the dependency is considered as narrow. For example \lstinline$map$, \lstinline$filter$, \lstinline$union$ and joins with \emph{co-partitioned} inputs create narrow dependencies. Narrow dependencies allow to process RDDs without triggering shuffling process -- a phenomenon known as \emph{pipelined execution}. Additionally, failure recovery is easier in case of narrow dependencies because only lost parent RDDs need to be recomputed. Figure~\ref{fig:sp:narrow-dep}\footnotemark depicts narrow dependencies.
    \item \textbf{Wide}. When one partition of the parent RDD is used by more than one partition of the child RDD, then the dependency is considered as wide. For example, \lstinline$groupByKey$ and joins with inputs \emph{not co-partitioned} create wide dependencies. Wide dependencies trigger the shuffling process. In contrast to narrow dependencies, recovering from node failures are less efficient since a failed node might cause loss of some partitions from all ancestors which requires full recomputation~\cite{Zaharia:2012}. Figure~\ref{fig:sp:wide-dep}\footnotemark[\value{footnote}] depicts wide dependencies.

    \end{figure}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fault-Tolerance with Checkpointing}
\label{sp:fault}

The idea of the lineage graph and recomputable transformations simplifies fault-recovery significantly. However, in long chains recomputing failed RDDs can be a very time/process intensive operation. Hence, in some cases it is useful to checkpoint some RDDs to stable storage -- like shared file system. In general checkpointing is useful for applications with deep lineage graphs containing wide dependencies, since a node failure in parent RDDs leads to full recomputation in child RDDs. If the lineage graph is small or most dependencies are narrow, checkpointing tends to be less useful. 

In order to provide full control to application developers, Spark exposes checkpointing behavior though its API -- via \lstinline$REPLICATE$ flag in \lstinline$persist()$ function -- and leaves the decision up to developers. There are some scenarios where automatic checkpointing without intervention of developers may seem a feasible choice. Because job scheduler is completely aware of the size all RDDs and naturally it should be able to implement more effective checkpointing strategy compared to developers. However, this feature is not currently available in Spark.

With checkpointing in-place, providing fault-tolerance becomes a fairly straightforward process. Note that, RDDs are immutable set of records. This feature makes it easy to flush them in a background process, since there is no \emph{concurrency} and \emph{consistency} concerns involved. Noteworthy, there is an additional fault-tolerance mechanism known as \emph{WAL-based fault-tolerance} for streaming pipelines. This topic is further discussed in section~\ref{sp:dstream}.

\subsection{RDDs and Spark Job Stages}
\label{sp:stage}

Spark's Job scheduler is similar to Dryad~\cite{Isard:2007}. However, it takes RDD locations into account as well, since some partitions of RDDs are cached into memory or persisted to stable storage. When a job is submitted, Spark's job scheduler does the following.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Calculating Lineage Graph}. In this step, Spark calculates the lineage graph of RDDs with corresponding transformations and dependencies.
    \item \textbf{Defining Stages}. In this step Spark defines the stages required to run the job. From developer's point of view a job is a sequence of RDDs. However, at runtime a job is modeled as \emph{Direct Acyclic Graph} (DAG) of stages. A \emph{stage} is basically the longest possible chain of RDD transformations with shuffling operations in the boundaries. Additionally, different partitions of RDDs in their corresponding stages will also be computed. 
    \item \textbf{Launching Tasks}. In this step, Spark launches \emph{tasks} which is going to be run by executors. Each task process one or multiple partitions of some RDDs. Depending on the location of RDDs, tasks will be launched on machines with data-locality awareness to reduce network transmission. In case a task fails, it can be run as long as parent stages are still available. If one or more parent stages become unavailable, missing partitions from parent stages shall be recomputed according to lineage graph.
\end{itemize}
Figure~\ref{fig:sp:logical} shows a sample job with logical operators and Figure~\ref{fig:sp:dag} depicts its corresponding DAG with two stages at runtime.

\section{Discretized Streams}
\label{sp:dstream}

Many modern big data applications process data in real-time as they enter the processing pipeline. Online machine learning, fraud detection, spam detection, etc. are just few examples of applications that require near real time processing of data. In order to process incoming records in near real-time, new generation of data processing frameworks has been emerged which is known as \emph{stream processing systems}. Apache Storm~\cite{Storm} is an example of stream processing systems. Although these systems provide stream processing pipelines, but they also come with a couple of deficiencies. First, section~\ref{sp:continues-model} explores the architecture of traditional stream processing systems and its problems. Then, section~\ref{sp:dstream-model} describes the new stream processing model known as \emph{Discretized Streams} (D-Streams)~\cite{Zaharia:2013} that is built on top of RDDs in order to resolve the problems of traditional model.

\subsection{Continuous Operator Processing Model}
\label{sp:continues-model}

Though the concept of stream processing is nothing new and there has been many proposals and implementations like~\cite{Grandl:2014:MPC}~\cite{Storm}~\cite{flink}, but most of these systems are based on a processing model known as \emph{Continuous Operator Processing Model}. In this model streaming computations are divided into a set of \emph{long-lived stateful} operators that process messages in a loop:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Get one or more messages from previous operators.
    \item Apply the computation -- business logic -- on newly received messages. Query the internal state if required.
    \item Update internal state if necessary.
    \item Produce any number of messages as the result of computation. These messages will be sent to next operators down the pipeline.
\end{itemize}

While continuous processing model minimizes latency, the stateful architecture of operators and nondeterminism that comes from record interleaving on the network, makes it hard to provide fault tolerance efficiently. In particular, recovering from a \emph{failed} or slow node -- \emph{stragglers} -- is challenging. The are usually two standard approaches to overcome these issues.
\begin{description}[leftmargin=0pt]
    \item[Replication] In replication model which is borrowed from database systems, there are two copies processing graphs. Produced messages are sent as duplicates to down stream operators. However, just replicating messages is not sufficient. A \emph{consensus protocol} should exist in-place to ensure that both operator replicas see incoming messages in the same order that is sent by upstream operators. Even though replication is a costly operation but it recovers from failures very fast, since both replicas are processing message online in synchronized steps.
    \item[Upstream Backup] The basic idea behind this model~\cite{Hwang:2005} is to checkpoint the internal state every once in a while to a stable shared storage. In case an operator -- or node -- fails, a backup operator takes over and reloads the last successfully written checkpoint. Then backup operator rebuilds the state by replying new messages and reproducing lost messages as necessary. Although this model is more efficient in terms of replication costs, but suffers from high fail-over time. Backup node should replay newly published messages from the last checkpoint and apply them to the internal state. Depending on checkpointing interval, this might be a time consuming operation.
\end{description}
Besides the fault-tolerance costs of this model, dealing with straggler nodes are even more challenging. Replication model provides no solution at all, since two replicas are processing messages synchronously. The only way to resolve this issue in Upstream Backup model is to fail -- kill -- the slow operator and let the backup operator takes over the responsibility which will undergo slow recovery process. Figure~\ref{fig:sp:cont-op} depicts these two approaches with additional synchronization and replication messages involved.
\begin{figure}[ht]

    \caption{Continuous Operator Processing Model}

\end{figure}

\subsection{D-Stream Processing Model}
\label{sp:dstream-model}

\emph{Discretized Streams} (D-Streams)~\cite{Zaharia:2013} is a novel technique to overcome the issues the Continuous Operator Processing Model. The basic idea behind D-Streams is to separate the computation from its state and keep the state as RDDs. This separation provides the following benefits.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Computation of messages becomes a set of \emph{stateless} and \emph{deterministic} tasks operating on RDDs.
    \item RDDs already provide resiliency through in-memory replication and lineage recomputation. There is no need for further mechanisms to provide fault-tolerance.
    \item Unified processing model for batch and stream processing.
\end{itemize}

As a consequence of storing operator intermediate state as RDDs, a streaming computation can be modeled as series of \emph{deterministic batch computations} on small intervals -- known as micro-batch. Messages received in each batch interval is stored reliably across the cluster to form an input dataset for that interval. Once the time interval completes, this dataset is processed just like traditional batch processing using \lstinline$map$, \lstinline$filter$, \lstinline$groupByKey$, etc. Formally, A D-Stream is a sequence of \emph{immutable}, \emph{partitioned} datasets (RDDs) that can be acted on by deterministic transformations~\cite{Zaharia:2013}. These  transformations produce new D-Streams, and may create intermediate state represented as RDDs. Figure~\ref{fig:sp:dstream-high} shows high-level D-Stream computation model.

In order to clarify D-Stream API, listing~\ref{l:sp:dstream-api}\footnotemark shows a simple streaming word count example. It creates a \lstinline$pageViews$ D-Stream by
reading even stream over TCP, and groups them into 1-second batch intervals. Then, it transforms the event stream to a new D-Stream of \lstinline$(URL,1)$ pairs called
\lstinline$ones$. Finally, it performs a running count with a \emph{stateful} \lstinline$runningReduce$ operator. Figure~\ref{fig:sp:dstream-api}\footnotemark[\value{footnote}] depicts the corresponding lineage graph and how the streams are divided are into batch intervals. Note that smaller rectangles illustrates RDD partitions.

val pageViews = readStream("tcp://...", "1s")
val ones           = pageViews.map(event => (event.url, 1))
val counts       = ones.runningReduce((a, b) => a + b)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Fault-Tolerant Message Consumption}
Since RDDs provide the basic building block of Spark Streaming, achieving fault-tolerance in streaming applications is a straightforward process. In case of any node failure, failed RDD partitions can be reproduced easily by evaluating lineage graph and determining which transformations need to be recomputed. Furthermore, for stateful transformations, Spark already provides checkpointing. However, there is one case that needs more attention.

Naturally, in streaming applications, live stream of records are coming from some data sources. For example, in log processing application it may originate from web servers or in live monitoring applications it comes from sensors. If one of the RDD transformations crashes during message consumption, two questions arise:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Are the messages that were consumed before crashing, be redelivered after relaunching failed transformations?
    \item In case lost messages are redelivered, will they be delivered with the same order as consumed before crashing?
\end{itemize}
The answer to these two questions leads us to \emph{three} types of data sources.
\begin{description}[leftmargin=0pt]
    \item[Reliable Ordered] With this type of data sources, the data source provides ordering and reliable message consumption capabilities. Messages will be kept in data source until its reliably confirmed -- ACKed -- by consumer. In case of consumer crash, messages will be delivered with the same order as before. Many of publish-subscribe message brokers such as Apache Kafka~\cite{kafka} provide this feature.
    \item[Reliable Unordered] With this type of data sources, the data source provides reliable message store but redelivery is not guaranteed with the same order as before consumer crash. For cases where ordered message consumption is crucial for business logic of the application, Spark Streaming provides \emph{WAL-based} consumers. With WAL-based consumers, each consumer appends the received message to a log file before starting to consume the message. These log files are stored in a distributed file system like HDFS. In case of consumer failure, another consumer re-opens the the log file and re-process the messages with same order as before.
    \item[Unreliable] This type of data source does not provide any form of reliability, ordering and fault-tolerance. Hence, WAL-based message consumption shall be enabled by application developer.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sp:conc}

In this chapter different aspects and features of Spark has been explored. Built on top of unique features of Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs), Spark offers a unified approach for batch and stream processing. As explained during the chapter, deficiencies and problems of traditional systems have been addressed to some extent by Spark.
