\section{Introduction}
In this chapter the two implemented techniques will be evaluated under three read world workloads. In order to show the effect of each configuration parameter, multiple experiments have been designed and deployed. Table~\ref{des:tab:config} defines the configuration space. First, characteristics of workload will be discussed in Section~\ref{eval:workload}. Thereafter, there is separate section for each experiment. Finally, Section~\ref{eval:conc} concludes this chapter.
