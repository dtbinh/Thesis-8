Dynamic resource scaling in cloud environments has been studied extensively in literature. As a naive implementation, there are two thresholds, namely \emph{upper bound} and \emph{lower bound}. However, such an implementation suffers from \emph{oscillating} decisions. In order remedy this issue, \emph{grace period} shall be enforced. During this period, no scaling decision is made. 

\textcite{Hasan2012IntegratedAA} introduced four thresholds and two time periods.
